# Kids News App

## About the Project

This repository contains the first stage of my **React coding course final project**. The application is designed to present daily news to children in an engaging and safe way. It allows kids to access a variety of topics, presented in a format suitable for their age group.

## Project Vision

While this is currently a frontend project built with React, I intend to continue developing it beyond this course as a long-term personal project with multiple future stages:

---

### Stage 1 – ✅ Current Stage

- Display latest news articles fetched from a public API.
- Categorize articles into child-friendly categories.
- Provide a simple, clear user interface for kids to browse articles.

---

### Stage 2 – Planned AI Integration

- Integrate **AI-powered summarization** to automatically rewrite news articles into simplified language that children can easily understand.
- Implement **vocabulary assistance**: highlight complex words and provide simple explanations to help children learn new words as they read.

---

### Stage 3 – Gamification

- Introduce **gamification elements** to motivate children to read regularly:
  - Earn points for reading articles.
  - Unlock achievements and badges.
  - Introduce a **leaderboard system**.
  - Encourage friendly competition while promoting educational reading habits.

## The Core Idea

In today’s world, children often consume content via social media algorithms that primarily serve them topics they're already interested in, leading to **algorithmic echo chambers**. This project aims to offer an **alternative educational platform** where kids can regularly access **objective, diverse, and balanced news** — beyond what algorithms suggest — and develop their awareness of current events from a young age.

## Technologies

- React
- Redux & Redux Toolkit
- CSS / Flexbox for responsive design
- NewsAPI / EventRegistry integration (future stages will expand on this)

---

I hope to eventually turn this into a fully functional educational tool for children, parents, and schools.
